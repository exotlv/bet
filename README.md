kino-test  Build Status
CucumberJVM template project for running tests in parallel.

This project was based on Selenium-Maven-Template and support for CucumberJVM was added

How to run

Execution options

One "Runner" class per thread (use profile parallel). By "Runner" class is meant RunCukesCheeseTest class in this example.
NOTE - in order to use this approach, you will need to create separate "runner" class per one thread. Tests belonging to one "runner" class will be executed sequentially.
More on this read here.
Using cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin (use profile parallelPlugin)
cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin will automatically generates "runner" classes.
More on this read here.
Command for execution

./mvnw clean verify -P [nogrid OR grid],[parallel OR parallelPlugin] -Dthreads=[number of parallel threads]
parallel - when using separate "runner" class per one thread
parallelPlugin - uses cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin. Automatically creates separate "runner" class per one thread
nogrid - execute tests locally
grid - execute tests on Selenium Grid. Grid Hub can be set in pom by using seleniumGridUrl property or in ApplicationProperties file
Thread count can be set via -Dthreads argument
For example, invoking

./mvnw clean verify -P parallelPlugin,nogrid -Dthreads=3 -Dbrowser=chrome -Dcucumber.options="--tags @bet"
will execute tests in parallel 3 threads on local machine and using cucumber-jvm-parallel-plugin plugin. In addition, -Dbrowser setting will set browser to Chrome.

Configuration

Following settings can be changed in lv.iljapavlovs.cucumber.config.ApplicationProperties.java or overriden by from command line by providing -D{configuration key}={value}

Configuration key	Description
env	environment name
appUrl	AUT URL
browser	Browser to use. Available options - chrome, firefox, safari, edge, ie, chrome_headless, firefox_headless
proxyEnabled	is proxy enabled for Selenium (boolean)
proxyHost	proxy host
proxyPort	proxy port
remoteDriver	should tests be executed on Selenium Grid (boolean)
seleniumGridRetries	RemoteWebdriver initialization retry count
seleniumGridUrl	Selenium Grid Hub URL
waitShortSeconds	timeout for explicit wait - shortest timeout
waitNormalSeconds	timeout for explicit wait - average timeout
waitLongSeconds	timeout for explicit wait - longest timeout
Reporting

Reports are generated by maven-cucumber-reporting plugin and can be found under target/site/cucumber-reports/cucumber-html-reports

Setting up Selenium Grid in Docker Containers

Selenium

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-selenium.yml up
Scaling

docker-compose scale selenium-hub=1 firefox=5 chrome=5 

This project uses webdrivermanager tool in order to automate the Selenium browser drivers management in runtime. It will automatically download all needed driver to your local PC if needed with specified version.
